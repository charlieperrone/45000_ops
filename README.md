The Electro Harmonix 45000 looper is a fabulous multitrack looper which allows a musician to record sounds into one of 4 tracks and mix them together. As a live looper, it works quite seamlessly for a user. One dimension of its use that I want to explore is as a 4 track playback device. I want to load the 45000 with stems and play them back for live performance, taking advantage of its performance functions, memory and immediacy. 

To do this requires alot of tedious folder management and precise operations. I would like to streamline this process by creating a set of tools that can spin up a properly formatted loop entry that can be put on an SD card and played back.
